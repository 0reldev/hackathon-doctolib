# Pilulib

## Hackathon from Wild Code School with Doctolib

### Introduction

From June 24th to 26th, 2020, **Wild Code School** organized an international code marathon in partnership with **Doctolib**, the leader in online appointments in France. More than 100 teams have taken this challenge.

#### Instructions

The teams have to develop an application in three days in relation with **telemedicine**.

The evaluation criteria taken into account by examiners were:
- UX design
- technical aspects
- concept
- oral presentation

Six subjects were proposed. We chose the sixth one: **free topic**.

### Presentation of the app

#### User stories - Features summary

Two main features were developped:
- **help to pillbox filling**: a user is helped in its pillbox filling by reading step-by-step personalized instructions. 
- **display of pillbox content**: a user can display an overview of the current medication in the pillbox

This app is thought to be connected with a Doctolib's user account. Medication prescription would be automatically loaded from the Doctolib database
and the pillbox instructions would adapt regarding to these information. That's the concept, for for this hackathon, a new database has been created
from zero for testing this application.

The presented result is a minimum vital product.

#### Screen captures

##### Pillbox filling help function

Step-by-step, explicit instructions are displayed. The user have medication's picutre not to counfound, the pills quantity and the posology.

Once that the user filled its pillbox, he can confirm to go ahead to the next step. 

In this example, there are 14 steps.

It's well worth noting that button  and font's size are intentionally big. This is a UX design choice to make the user experience as clear as possible and extremely visible, considering than the average user of this application probably would be old with a potential bad sight and few experience with web applications.

When the filling is over, a validation message is displayed.
